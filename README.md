# Covid_Portfolio_project

COVID-19 Portfolio Project:
This project explores COVID-19 data using SQL. The aim of the project is to extract, transform and load data from a publicly available COVID-19 dataset and use SQL to gain insights and visualize trends in the data.

Data:
The data used in this project was sourced from the Our World in Data COVID-19 dataset. This dataset provides daily statistics on COVID-19 cases and deaths, as well as vaccination rates, for countries around the world. The data is provided in a CSV file and is updated daily.

Tools:
This project uses SQL to extract and analyze the COVID-19 data. Specifically, the data is loaded into a SQLite database using Python and the Pandas library. SQL queries are then used to extract and analyze the data
